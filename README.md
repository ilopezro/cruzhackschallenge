# Cruz Hacks Backend/Frontend Challenge

# Steps to run app locally 
1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate into the root of the project folder and run 
  npm install
  in order to install all the dependencies 
3. Finally fun the following two pieces of code (preferably in seperate windows)
  nodemon index.js 
        and
  npm start
  
  This will start the server and will then deploy the app in which you will be able to see 
  in localhost:3000 (server will be in localhost:3001)
 
# Live webpage 
I have also deployed the webpage using heroku; however, I ran into some issues when it came to loading the page online. 
The link to the live site is: 
https://cruzhackschallenge.herokuapp.com/

Using this link will load a blank page, but navigating to https://cruzhackschallenge.herokuapp.com/checkin should load the check in page, in which you can naviagate around the site freely.
