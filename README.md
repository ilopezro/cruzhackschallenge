# Cruz Hacks Backend/Frontend Challenge

# Steps to run app locally 
#####  1. Clone the repo

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ilopezro/cruzhackschallenge.git
$ cd cruzhackschallenge
```

##### 2. Install the dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

##### 3. Running the app locally 
In one terminal window(still at root of the project folder) run:
```bash
$ nodemon index.js
```

In a separete terminal window(still at root of the project) run:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Once those two commands have excecuted, you should see the app locally on port 3000 and the backend should be in 3001
 
# Live webpage 
I have also deployed the webpage using heroku; however, I ran into some issues when it came to loading the page online. 
The link to the live site is: 
https://cruzhackschallenge.herokuapp.com/

Using this link will load a blank page, but navigating to https://cruzhackschallenge.herokuapp.com/checkin should load the check in page, in which you can naviagate around the site freely.
